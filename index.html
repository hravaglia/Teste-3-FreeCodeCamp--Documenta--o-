         <p>A tattoo is a form of body modification made by inserting tattoo ink, dyes, and/or pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to form a design. Tattoo artists create these designs using several tattooing processes and techniques, including hand-tapped traditional tattoos and modern tattoo machines. The history of tattooing goes back to Neolithic times, practiced across the globe by many cultures, and the symbolism and impact of tattoos varies in different places and cultures. </p>
         <p>Tattoos may be decorative (with no specific meaning), symbolic (with a specific meaning to the wearer), pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item), or textual (words or pictographs from written languages). Many tattoos serve as rites of passage, marks of status and rank, symbols of religious and spiritual devotion, decorations for bravery, marks of fertility, pledges of love, amulets and talismans, protection, and as punishment, like the marks of outcasts, slaves and convicts. Extensive decorative tattooing has also been part of the work of performance artists such as tattooed ladies. </p>
         <p>Although tattoo art has existed at least since the first known tattooed person, Ötzi, lived around the year 3330 BC, the way society perceives tattoos has varied immensely throughout history. In the 20th century, tattoo art throughout most of the world was associated with a limited selection of specific "rugged" lifestyles, notably sailors and prisoners. Today, people choose to be tattooed for artistic, cosmetic, sentimental/memorial, religious, and spiritual reasons, or to symbolize their belonging to or identification with particular groups, including criminal gangs (see criminal tattoos) or a particular ethnic group or law-abiding subculture. Tattoos may show how a person feels about a relative (commonly a parent or child) or about an unrelated person</p>

          None of this is important in the tattooing process, but it is cool to know =)

         <code>Put some music on and let's go!</code>
         <p>Using alcohol 70% and paper towel, you can start cleaning everything you gonna use for the tattoo, from chair to tattoo machine. Don't spare alcohol because everything in touch with the client's skin must be clean without any bacteria and dirt.</p>
         <ul>
        <li>
          From now on, every single step, including this one, must be done by using gloves (latex are the most common type)

         <code>Hardest part O.o</code>
         <p>Shave the client's skin with shaving cream or with your soap solution, clean the skin with more alcohol. Put the stencil where the tattoo will be made and use a pen or sharpie to mark the region you will apply the Stencil Transfer, apply the Stencil Transfer and carefully put the design on the skin. If you mess up, just clean the area with alcohol and try again!</p>

          If there are any other tattoo artist near you, just ask for help if needed.

         <code>Payment time $$</code>
         <p>After the tattoo is done, be shure to apply your post-tattoo creams and/or plastic, clean everything up (remember to properly discard your needles) and it's over!</p>
         <ul>
        <li>
           Now you can waste as many time as you want in your photoshoot (maybe that's the hardest part).
